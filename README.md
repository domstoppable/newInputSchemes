# NewInputSchemes
Software to evalute gesture, gaze, and combination input schemes as a replacement to the computer mouse.

## Requirements
* EyeTribe
* Leap Motion Controller
* Leap SDK (with Python bindings built for your version/platform (last tested on Python 3.4-x64))

## Usage
Everything is in the GUI. Run `main.py` and select the button for the input shceme you want to run. A score is generated after practice to give an indication of performance (based on # correct and speed).

When running an input scheme, press `o` to open the options dialogue for the input scheme you are using, which includes calibration options.
